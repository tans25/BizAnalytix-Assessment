# BizAnalytix-Assessment
## Brief Description of the project 
This project is a machine learning project made using Python and it's libraries. It takes the spam and ham mail files and builds one model to vectorize the text inside them. Another model is build a classification model to predict whether the given text is spam or ham. The project is in the form of a Python Jupyter Notebook. 

## Execution Instructions 
The file can run on Jupyter or any other IDE which supports Jupyter Notebooks. The spam and ham files need to be in the same folder as the notebook for it to run. The project needs a cell-by-cell execution. 

The following libraries are used: 
1. Numpy 
2. Pandas 
3. OS
4. re (regex)
5. NLTK - for Stemming the text
6. Scikit-learn (sklearn) - for splitting data into training and testing dataset and model building
